/* lets understand objects in javascript basics
lets suppose you have a drawer in which you keep things of school like
notebook - maths subject
pen - blue color pen
eraser - dustless eraser

if someone asks you in which drawer did you keep the notebook of maths, then you will tell him us drawer main rakha hai jisem notebook likha hai 

Javascript main bhi kuch aisa hi hota hai jab humko data ko organize karna hota hai toh hum object use karte hai 

object is like drawer which uses key-value pairs
key woh cheez hoti hai jo describe karti hai (jaise ki notebook,pen) and value wo cheez hai jo key ko represent karti hai jaise math ki copy blue pen  */

// an object structure looks like this

let schoolbag = {
    notebook : "mathcopy",
    pen : "blue pen",
    eraser : "dustless eraser"
};

// notebook is key and math copy is value
// pen is key and blue pen is value

// how to create objects 

let person = {
    name: "aashish",
    age: "20",
    city: "surat"
};

// yeh object ka matlab hai ki humne kisi insaan ka data store kiya jiska naam aashish hai umar 20 and seher surat hai
